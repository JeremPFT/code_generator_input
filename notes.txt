* prevent regenerating a file
In root package =Model=, I may add constants, errors, renames...
* give subprogram body
Queries and commands for vector are straightforward.

For some subprograms, I want to give the definition, either in the specification
file, or in an attached file (maybe using the qualified namespace).

for
- Model::Element::Object_T::Has_Owner
create the file
- model-element-object_t-has_owner.adb
with
: function Has_Owner
:   (Self: in Object_T)
:   return Boolean
:   is (Self.Owner /= null);

When this file exists, the use it to generate the definition in the body,
otherwised generate a separate file.
